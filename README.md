## Page View Time Series Visualizer
### Data Analysis with Python Projects
### [freecodecamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-analysis-with-python/data-analysis-with-python-projects/page-view-time-series-visualizer)

For this project you will visualize time series data using a line chart, bar chart, and box plots. You will use Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to
visualize a dataset containing the number of page views each day on the freeCodeCamp.org forum from 2016-05-09 to 2019-12-03. The
data visualizations will help you understand the patterns in visits and identify yearly and monthly growth.
